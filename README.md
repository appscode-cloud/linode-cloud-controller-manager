## The purpose of the CCM

The Linode Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) creates a fully supported
Kubernetes experience on Linode.

* Load balancers, Linode NodeBalancers, are automatically deployed when a
[Kubernetes Service of type "LoadBalancer"](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer) is deployed. This is the most
reliable way to allow services running in your cluster to be reachable from
the Internet.
* Linode hostnames and network addresses (private/public IPs) are automatically
associated with their corresponding Kubernetes resources, forming the basis for
a variety of Kubernetes features.
* Nodes resources are put into the correct state when Linodes are shut down,
allowing pods to be appropriately rescheduled.
* Nodes are annotated with the Linode region, which is the basis for scheduling based on
failure domains.

## Kubernetes Supported Versions

Kubernetes 1.9+

## Usage

### LoadBalancer Services

Kubernetes Services of type `LoadBalancer` will be served through a [Linode NodeBalancer](https://www.linode.com/nodebalancers) which the Cloud Controller Manager will provision on demand.  For general feature and usage notes, refer to the [Getting Started with Linode NodeBalancers](https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/nodebalancer/getting-started-with-nodebalancers/) guide.

#### Annotations

The Linode CCM accepts several annotations which affect the properties of the underlying NodeBalancer deployment.

All of the service annotation names listed below have been shortened for readability.  Each annotation **MUST** be prefixed with `service.beta.kubernetes.io/linode-loadbalancer-`.  The values, such as `http`, are case-sensitive.

Annotation (Suffix) | Values | Default | Description
---|---|---|---
`throttle` | `0`-`20` (`0` to disable) | `20` | Client Connection Throttle, which limits the number of subsequent new connections per second from the same client IP
`protocol` | `tcp`, `http`, `https` | `tcp` | This annotation is used to specify the default protocol for Linode NodeBalancer. For ports specified in the `linode-loadbalancer-tls-ports` annotation, this protocol is overwritten to `https`
`stickiness` | `none`, `table`, `http_cookie` | `none` | Controls how session stickiness is handled on this port.
`algorithm` | `round_robin`, `least_connections` | `round_robin` | Specifies which algorithm the Linode NodeBalancer should use
`tls` | json array (e.g. `[ { "tls-secret-name": "prod-app-tls", "port": 443}, {"tls-secret-name": "dev-app-tls", "port": 8443} ]`) | | Specifies TLS ports with their corresponding secrets, the secret type should be `kubernetes.io/tls`
`check-type` | `none`, `connection`, `http`, `http_body` | | The type of health check to perform against back-ends to ensure they are serving requests
`check-path` | string | | The URL path to check on each back-end during health checks
`check-body` | string | | Text which must be present in the response body to pass the NodeBalancer health check
`check-interval` | int | | Duration, in seconds, to wait between health checks
`check-timeout` | int (1-30) | | Duration, in seconds, to wait for a health check to succeed before considering it a failure
`check-attempts` | int (1-30) | | Number of health check failures necessary to remove a back-end from the service
`check-passive` | bool | `false` | When `true`, `5xx` status codes will cause the health check to fail

For example,

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-lsmnl-wordpress
  namespace: wordpress-lsmnl
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/linode-loadbalancer-throttle: "4"
  labels:
    app: wordpress-lsmnl-wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  clusterIP: 10.97.58.169
  externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
  ports:
  - name: http
    nodePort: 32660
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: http
  - name: https
    nodePort: 30806
    port: 443
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: https
  selector:
    app: wordpress-lsmnl-wordpress
  sessionAffinity: None
```

#### SSL Termination

Linode NodeBalancers include SSL Termination features which are described in the official [NodeBalancer SSL Configuration](https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/nodebalancer/nodebalancer-ssl-configuration/#install-the-ssl-certificate-and-private-key-on-your-nodebalancer) guide.  Supplemental  details can be found in the [Linode APIv4 NodeBalancer: Create Config](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4#operation/createNodeBalancerConfig) documentation.

When using these features in the Cloud Controller Manager, it is important to provide all of the required parameters and properly formatted values.

When supplying or implying an `https` value for the `service.beta.kubernetes.io/linode-loadbalancer-protocol` annotation, the following annotations are required:

* `service.beta.kubernetes.io/linode-loadbalancer-ssl-key`
* `service.beta.kubernetes.io/linode-loadbalancer-ssl-cert`

## Generating a Manifest for Deployment

Use the script located at `./hack/deploy/generate-manifest.sh` to generate a self-contained deployment manifest for the Linode CCM. Two arguments are required.

The first argument must be a Linode APIv4 Personal Access Token with all permissions.
(https://cloud.linode.com/profile/tokens)

The second argument must be a Linode region.
(https://api.linode.com/v4/regions)

Example:

```sh
./generate-manifest.sh $LINODE_API_TOKEN us-east
```

This will create a file `ccm-linode.yaml` which you can use to deploy the CCM.

`kubectl apply -f ccm-linode.yaml`

Note: Your kubelets, controller-manager, and apiserver must be started with `--cloud-provider=external` as noted in the following documentation.

### Upstream Documentation Including Deployment Instructions

[Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/).

## Development Guide

### Building the Linode Cloud Controller Manager

Some of the Linode Cloud Controller Manager development helper scripts rely
on a fairly up-to-date GNU tools environment, so most recent Linux distros
should work just fine out-of-the-box.

#### Setup Go

The Linode Cloud Controller Manager is written in Google's Go programming
language. Currently, the Linode Cloud Controller Manager is developed and
tested on **Go 1.8.3**. If you haven't set up a Go development environment,
please follow [these instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) to
install Go.

On macOS, Homebrew has a nice package

```bash
brew install golang
```

#### Download Source

```bash
go get github.com/linode/linode-cloud-controller-manager
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/linode/linode-cloud-controller-manager
```

#### Install Dev tools

To install various dev tools for Pharm Controller Manager, run the following command:

```bash
./hack/builddeps.sh
```

#### Build Binary

Use the following Make targets to build and run a local binary

```bash
$ make build
$ make run
# You can also run the binary directly to pass additional args
$ dist/linode-cloud-controller-manager run
```

#### Dependency management

Linode Cloud Controller Manager uses [Dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) to
manage dependencies. Dependencies are already checked in the `vendor` folder.
If you want to update/add dependencies, run:

```bash
dep ensure
```

#### Building Docker images

To build and push a Docker image, use the following make targets. 

```bash
# Set the repo/image:tag with the TAG environment variable
# Then run the docker-build make target
$ IMG=linode/linode-cloud-controller-manager:canary make docker-build

# Push Image
$ IMG=linode/linode-cloud-controller-manager:canary make docker-push
```

Then, to run the image

```bash
docker run -ti linode/linode-cloud-controller-manager:canary
```
